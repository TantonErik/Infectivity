#Dad's virus infectivity game
#basic idea, you have a screen of black balls. You can only see them if you shine a flashlight on it. (TESTING) 1 of the balls are by default red (Infected and dying) after a select amount of time that ball will dissapear(die). Every
#ball that it touches infects it and it turns yellow. If you spend money you can buy a "bomb" to cure all of the yellow balls. You cannot cure red balls. Or you can spend money to have more flashlights looking. The goal is to cure
#every ball.
#it is going to be programmed in python, and in a set resolution (to help make things simple)
#there is going to have to be a function for infectivity, movement, and the ability to bounce. every ball will hae a class?
